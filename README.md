- OMP for paralleling
- CMake as build system
- [osmanip](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip) as external library

## Install and Use

- Install [osmanip](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip) as written [here](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip?tab=readme-ov-file#install)
- Download our latest release
- In the downloaded folder:
  ```
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  ```
- Compile project:
  ```
  $ make
  ```
- And run it:
  ```
  $ ./TetrisBot
  ```
  If you want to change the number of threads (by default all threads are used), you should run the project like this:
  ```
  $ OMP_NUM_THREADS=x ./TetrisBot
  ```
  where `x` is preferred number of threads.
  
  **Note**: If you want to change the time between frames, you have to go in `settings.h`, change the value of `FrameTime` to whatever you want, and then compile project again. In the same way, you can change the number of pieces known to the bot (value of `KnownPiecesCount`), but keep in mind that the calculation time will grow exponentially.
